# ICS3U Codespaces Setup Repo

Use this repo to setup an ICS3U Codespace.

It includes everything you will need to Python and C/C++.

Once the CodeSpace is up and running:
- open the terminal
- create a directory called "ICS3U" (`mkdir ICS3U`)
- change directory into the new ICS3U directory (cd ICS3U)
- open CodeSpaces in this new directory (code .)
- then setup your GitHub SSH keys (https://ics3u.mths.ca/references/github-ssh-keys)
