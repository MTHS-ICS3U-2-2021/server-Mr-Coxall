# ICS3U Codespaces Setup Repo

Use this repo to setup an ICS3U Codespace.

It includes everything you will need to Python and C/C++.

Once the CodeSpace is up and running, in the terminal:
- move to the home directory (`cd ~` or just `cd`)
- create a directory called "ICS3U" (`mkdir ICS3U`)
- change directory into the new ICS3U directory (`cd ICS3U`)
- open CodeSpaces in this new directory (`code .`)
- a new Codespace will open up, close the old one and move to the new one
- then setup your GitHub SSH keys (see: https://sites.google.com/ocsb.ca/teh-ics3ur/references/github-ssh-keys)
